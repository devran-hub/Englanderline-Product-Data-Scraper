# Englanderline-Product-Data-Scraper
I have created a scraper that scrapes different product datas from a whole website.
A Python project named 'englander.py' is created to scrape datas and it uses Scrapy Python library. You can view the code and scraped data by the code above.

## What does this project do?
This project scrapes infos of product in different columns and does this process for each product that was upladed to the website

You can see which infos was scraped in an example product page below
