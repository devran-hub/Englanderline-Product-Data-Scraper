# Englanderline-Product-Data-Scraper
I have created a scraper that scrapes different product datas from a whole website and stores them into an excel sheet.
A Python project named 'englander.py' is created to scrape datas and it uses Scrapy Python library. You can view the code above and scraped data through this link https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tmnlYycwjlDtSD5RS4WfujW5tU6NRsWh/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113361500236449805704&rtpof=true&sd=true

## What does this project do?
This project scrapes infos of product in different columns and does this process for each product that was upladed to the website

You can see which infos was scraped in an example product page below
