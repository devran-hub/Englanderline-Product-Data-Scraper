# Englanderline-Product-Data-Scraper
I have created a scraper that scrapes different product datas from a whole website and stores them into an excel sheet.
A Python project named 'englander.py' is created to scrape datas and it uses Scrapy Python library. You can view the code above and scraped data through this link: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tmnlYycwjlDtSD5RS4WfujW5tU6NRsWh/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=113361500236449805704&rtpof=true&sd=true

Additionaly, there is an alternative excel output above that scraped image urls instead of images.

you can also see example output below
